# Map Coloring Problem Solver
About the Project
This project implements an AI-based solution to the Map Coloring Problem using algorithms like Backtracking,
Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP), and Heuristics. The goal is to color a map such that no two adjacent
regions share the same color, adhering to a specified number of colors.

# Features
  Flexible Input: Supports custom map graphs and color constraints.
  Optimized Algorithms: Implements backtracking with advanced heuristics like:
  Minimum Remaining Values (MRV)
  Degree Heuristic
  Least Constraining Value (LCV)
  Performance Monitoring: Tracks the number of steps, backtracking points, and execution time.
  Visual Representation: Outputs a visual graph of the colored map.
